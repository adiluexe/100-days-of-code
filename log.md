# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: August 8, 2024 (Thursday)

Sup it's Day 4 and I'm 56% through the Foundations Course. I just finished the margin and padding css exercises and I'm gonna end today there, tomorrow we'll start with Flexbox and hopefully at the JavaScript section which I'm still struggling with.

We basically started off today at the Commit Messages lesson which I reread, then did the recipes project. I still haven't added the styles yet for that, but I'm definitely gonna do like a big project with it when I'm almost done with the Foundations Course which I believe we can do for about a month, since we've already progressed through it 2 times, and now's the third. Anyways, I pretty much breezed through the CSS lessons and the exercises. I did kinda skip through the Chrome Dev Tools part, I'll save that for next time, I figured rather than force myself to study that part and lose momentum, I'd rather save it for another time where I'll absolutely need it. I did like knowing about the `CSS Overview` part of the Dev Tools. Now that's something that I know is immediately useful for me.

We also spent around 4 hours today, good job again. Classes are coming up soon, but I hope you still remember to do these independent studies and keep logging here. Again, good job me.

### Day 3: August 7, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 3 and my mom's birthday, someday I hope to give her the life she deserves.

I'm 41% through the Foundations Course in The Odin Project (TOP), I'm right about done with the Commit Messages lesson, but I will read through it again tomorrow. I basically blitzed through the HTML sections and read the additional sources in case there's some info I missed. I recently finished the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course so I think I'll revisit that if my HTML still needs some work.

I spent around 4 hours studying today, the longest session we've had so far. You're doing great me, keep it up.

### Day 2: August 6, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey it's Day 2 and I'm 20% through with the Foundations Course, I'm almost finished with the Preqrequisites section, I spent almost 4 hours today with The Odin Proect, about 1 hour of that was trying to setup WSL2 in my device. I had installed it previously, but I thought It wasn't working so I reinstalled it again, and that's where I encountered some problems and spent extra time on, but it's all hopefully over.

I mostly learned about computers today, and some background on the web and basically things related to it. I'm nearly done with the Command Line Basics, but I think It's better if I finish it tommorow. It's currently 8pm while I'm writing this and I'm gonna call it day, need to rest even if I think I could still do more. You deserve it, keep up the good work.

### Day 1: August 5, 2024 (Monday)

I started The Odin Project from the beginning for like I think the 3rd time again. (This time will be different ;3).

I'm 10% through the Foundations Course, having just finished reading through the Introduction section. I think I spent a total of 3 hours studying today, I definitely could've done more, regardless, good job me.

Mostly learned about how to develop the mindset that will make help me succeed in everything. Here's to making it.
