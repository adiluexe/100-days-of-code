# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: August 14, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 10, it's only 8:30 PM but I'm call it a day, because I'm tired. I managed to squeeze in some dev time during my easier subjects. Not necessarily easy but it was just a short orientation so I spent that time building and debugging the number guessing game from MDN. And just now I was able to fix one annoying bug, which was really just a simple fix. This is my fault for not trusting the Chrome Dev Tools, because I was entirely convinced that one element was causing the problem, until I inspected it and it was a completely different element, which I was then able to fix immediately. Always keep the developers tools open. Lesson learned. Trust the devtools, study the devtools.

Anyways after that I did a couple of freeCodeCamp lessons. I'm on the Building a Calorie Counter part, I hope I can continue more tomorrow. Goodnight, good luck and keep going.

### Day 9: August 13, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hello it's Day 9 and today was my shortest study session so far. I think I only crammed about an hour or so in the morning. I think I finished 2 lessons in The Odin Project today which was Problem Solving and Understanding Errors. I finally did one of MDN's active learning section earlier - the one about error handling, and they were pretty good. I finally forked their repo and I might just have to finish it all sometime.

After I got home from school, I finally attempted the rock paper scissors project, and then failed when I realized I still couldn't do it from scratch without searching for answers immediately. I figured I'll save this project for when I can comfortably do it without guides. That's when I made the switch to freeCodeCamp again and finished one quick lesson earlier, surprisingly about debugging. I also practiced my frontend skills a bit by improving the UI of said project. I think I'll stick with freeCodeCamp for now at least until I finish their rock paper scissors project, which they also have. Anyways, good job again today, keep doing this.

### Day 8: August 12, 2024 (Monday)

Hey it's Day 8, and today was the first day of me being a 3rd Year Computer Science Student. The subject was calculus earlier and we reviewed Algebra, which I embarrassingly struggled with a lot. I will definitely get back on reviewing Algebra. Do not make this an excuse. WE CAN DO BOTH. We just need to plan things better, it's only the first week things will get better, you'll find your groove.

Anyways, back to our independent studies. You made the right decision earlier of doing this early in the morning when you still had time. Tomorrow we might not have enough time, but try to squeeze in at least an hour of just reading shit and immersing yourself to the programming culture. I think we have some spare time in between classes you can use that. Read when you can't code. It still counts.

Now back to what we accomplished today. I only managed to kinda complete one lesson in Odin which was about Problem Solving. After that I went ahead and played around with the freeCodeCamp project I did yesterday, and I just finished it, check it out [here](https://adiluexe.github.io/basic-js-rpg/) in all it's mediocre glory.

I did not add a lot in the JavaScript part of the code. It's mostly improving the copywriting and design of things, which I'm still proud of. I added new description objects for the monsters; updated the dialogue and options; and overhauled the entire UI. My JavaScript skills still suck, but I'm definitely getting better at CSS and the frontend side of things. Of course I'm still confused on why it's not being responsive like I thought it would, I keep using `100vh` for the landing page and it's not working right when the page content is larger than that or when I scale it down. But that's beside the point, I made stuff today, just keep making stuff, eventually everything will just be natural to you. Keep going me, good luck, and see you tomorrow.

### Day 7: August 11, 2024 (Sunday)

It's officially been a week since I started learning how to code, again (fr this time). I'm 75% through TOP's Foundation Course in just a week! This took me months when I first stumbled upon this course. That being said, I wasn't speeding through or anything, in fact I only kinda finished one lesson today in TOP, which was the Function Basics along with its assignment. There were a lot of readings that I skimmed through and plan to read through again tomorrow. This time I once again focused on freeCodeCamp, specifically the [Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game) project which I finished in one sitting today. My plan tomorrow is to maybe finish the TOP lessons until the first project, and then revamp the project I just finished in freeCodeCamp.

I know that we'll be starting of our classes tomorrow, but don't make that an excuse you know you can squeeze in at least 2 hours of your time everyday with this. We've always done well at school, somehow, but I know you also realize that being just good at university and having high grades isn't enough. I'm not asking you to prioritize one thing over another, I'm asking you to do both, and I know you can. Do well in class, while also doing your independent studies. I'm proud of you. Keep going. I'll see you tomorrow, and everyday after that.

### Day 6: August 10, 2024 (Saturday)

Day 6 and almost a week through. Today I started learning about JavaScript. I only managed to complete 2 lessons in the JavaScript basics of TOP. There was too much reading involved about something I'm not used to yet. I figured rather than force myself into that and kill my momentum (I almost didn't wanna study today), I should just switch resources, which was part of my plan after all. That's why I started freeCodeCamp's JS Course. I managed to finish the first two projects, which gave me the motivation to read through the lessons set by TOP, which was still hard to go through.

I kinda skipped over the Dev Tools part again, but tomorrow I'll watch like a couple videos on it instead. I was surpirsed that I was able to study for around 5 hours today, because I did not start off motivated with all the reading. Good on you for having plans in case this happens, and following through with it.

If TOP is getting difficult for you, switch to freeCodeCamp, if even that is getting to be too difficult for you, watch some videos about the topic, and if that still doesn't work - take a break. You might just be tired. Anyways, good job for today, keep at it.

### Day 5: August 9, 2024 (Friday)

Day 5. I just finished the Flexbox section, including the flexbox exercises, and the landing page project. I pretty much finished the flexbox exercises in under and hour this time, and without looking anything up. That's right no Google, no ChatGpt, just pure experience. I remember struggling with this section when I first encountered, and me taking like almost a week to finish it all. Naturally, my confidence was at an all time high having finished something I struggled with for days, in less than an hour.

I thought I had mastered CSS layouts by now, but when I attempted the landing page page - I realized I still had a long way to go. I particularly struggled with how my sections keep overlapping, and overflowing with each other. But credit where credit's due :3, I did do this in like 2 hours while watching The Umbrella Academy on the side, and I did eventually fix it.

Keep going me, we spent a little over 6 hours today, I'm proud of you.

### Day 4: August 8, 2024 (Thursday)

Sup it's Day 4 and I'm 56% through the Foundations Course. I just finished the margin and padding css exercises and I'm gonna end today there, tomorrow we'll start with Flexbox and hopefully at the JavaScript section which I'm still struggling with.

We basically started off today at the Commit Messages lesson which I reread, then did the recipes project. I still haven't added the styles yet for that, but I'm definitely gonna do like a big project with it when I'm almost done with the Foundations Course which I believe we can do for about a month, since we've already progressed through it 2 times, and now's the third. Anyways, I pretty much breezed through the CSS lessons and the exercises. I did kinda skip through the Chrome Dev Tools part, I'll save that for next time, I figured rather than force myself to study that part and lose momentum, I'd rather save it for another time where I'll absolutely need it. I did like knowing about the `CSS Overview` part of the Dev Tools. Now that's something that I know is immediately useful for me.

We also spent around 4 hours today, good job again. Classes are coming up soon, but I hope you still remember to do these independent studies and keep logging here. Again, good job me.

### Day 3: August 7, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 3 and my mom's birthday, someday I hope to give her the life she deserves.

I'm 41% through the Foundations Course in The Odin Project (TOP), I'm right about done with the Commit Messages lesson, but I will read through it again tomorrow. I basically blitzed through the HTML sections and read the additional sources in case there's some info I missed. I recently finished the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course so I think I'll revisit that if my HTML still needs some work.

I spent around 4 hours studying today, the longest session we've had so far. You're doing great me, keep it up.

### Day 2: August 6, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey it's Day 2 and I'm 20% through with the Foundations Course, I'm almost finished with the Prerequisites section, I spent almost 4 hours today with The Odin Project, about 1 hour of that was trying to setup WSL2 in my device. I had installed it previously, but I thought It wasn't working so I reinstalled it again, and that's where I encountered some problems and spent extra time on, but it's all hopefully over.

I mostly learned about computers today, and some background on the web and basically things related to it. I'm nearly done with the Command Line Basics, but I think It's better if I finish it tomorrow. It's currently 8pm while I'm writing this and I'm gonna call it day, need to rest even if I think I could still do more. You deserve it, keep up the good work.

### Day 1: August 5, 2024 (Monday)

I started The Odin Project from the beginning for like I think the 3rd time again. (This time will be different ;3).

I'm 10% through the Foundations Course, having just finished reading through the Introduction section. I think I spent a total of 3 hours studying today, I definitely could've done more, regardless, good job me.

Mostly learned about how to develop the mindset that will make help me succeed in everything. Here's to making it.
